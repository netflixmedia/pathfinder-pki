An RFC3280 compliant X.509 certificate validator.

= Introduction =

One thing has been missing for quite a while in the Linux and Open Source community, and that is a standard way to validate X.509 certificates. Now, there have been some efforts, as the Netscape/Mozilla LibNSS people have done quite a bit of work, and the [http://www.gnupg.org/aegypten/ Ägypten project] has an implementation that works with a good portion of programs that use gpgsm. But, for the most part, it appears that there hasn't been an effort to create a common framework that allows for the definition and configuration of trust anchors, and the validation of X.509 certificates. So, [http://www.carillon.ca Carillon Information Security] decided to sponsor a project to create that framework.

The goals of Pathfinder are to enable:

 * Bridge Aware PKI validation
 * Certificate Policy mapping and validation
 * Full Authority Info Access certificate fetching
 * Dynamic CRL fetching
 * Easy Integration into both the OpenSSL and Netscape LibNSS frameworks.
